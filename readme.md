# Redirect Template

This is an OU Campus template (TCF, TMPL, Image) that creates a simple meta redirect page. This allows you to create a "page" in a folder named `/rd` that will effectively become a short URL that points to the full page. 

## PHP Redirect

This package includes a `/php-redirect` folder that contains an alternative redirect option, allowing the user to create a page in one location that publishes a PHP redirect pointing to another specified location through the use of the PHP `header` function. This templateuses a PCF page transformed by XSL code to make the redirect location easily editable. The XSL could also be modified by a web developer to output different types of redirects.
